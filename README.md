This repository contains data and scripts used in the analysis of rural-urban mortality/morbidity in Brazil. This is a work in progress developed by researchers from the [International Policy Centre for the Inclusive Growth](https://ipcig.org) and from the Department of Demography of CEDEPLAR (Federal University of Minas Gerais).

A version of the paper will be presented at the Poster Session 7 of the [Population Association of America 2020 annual meeting](http://www.populationassociation.org/sidebar/annual-meeting/).

The paper will discuss the rural-urban health and mortality differentials in Brazil using the [Brazilian 2010 National Census](https://censo2010.ibge.gov.br/) and the [Brazilian 2013 National Health Survey](https://www.ibge.gov.br/en/statistics/social/justice-and-security/16840-national-survey-of-health.html?=&t=o-que-e) data.
